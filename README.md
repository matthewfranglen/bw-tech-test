============

This is the simple static website I created for the brandwatch tech test.
You can view it [here](https://matthewfranglen.github.io/bw-tech-test/index.html).

I'm releasing this because the tech test this is based on is not used. It will also be pretty obvious if you use this code.

The three solutions the website shows are available:

 * The [Good Solution](https://github.com/matthewfranglen/bw-good)
 * The [Bad Solution](https://github.com/matthewfranglen/bw-bad)
 * The [Ugly Solution](https://github.com/matthewfranglen/bw-ugly)
